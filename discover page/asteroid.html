            <h2>Introduction to Asteroid</h2>
            <p><strong>Asteroids</strong>, sometimes called minor planets, are rocky remnants left over from the early formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago.</p>
            <p>Most of this ancient space rubble can be found orbiting our Sun between Mars and Jupiter within the main asteroid belt.<br>
            Most asteroids are irregularly shaped, though a few are nearly spherical, and they are often pitted or cratered. As they revolve around the Sun in elliptical orbits, the asteroids also rotate, sometimes quite erratically, tumbling as they go.<br>
            Some asteroids are known to have a small companion moon (some have two moons). There are also binary (double) asteroids, in which two rocky bodies of roughly equal size orbit each other, as well as triple asteroid systems.

            <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Most asteroids are composed of rock and metal, similar to the material found in the inner planets like Earth.</li>
                <li>Asteroids contain valuable resources such as metals, water, and organic compounds. </li>
                <li>Asteroids could serve as potential waystations or refueling depots for future interstellar travel. </li>

            <h2>Asteroids</h2>
            <p>Asteroids are small, rocky objects that orbit the Sun, but they are much smaller than planets.
                They are sometimes called minor planets and are remnants left over from the early formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago.
                Asteroids range in size from Vesta, which is about 329 miles (530 kilometers) in diameter, to bodies that are less than 33 feet (10 meters) across.
                The total mass of all the asteroids combined is less than that of Earth's Moon.</p>
            <p>Most asteroids can be found orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter within the main asteroid belt.
                There are at least 1,351,400 known asteroids, and they come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and compositions.
                Asteroids are not all round like planets; they have jagged and irregular shapes.
                Some asteroids are hundreds of miles in diameter, but many more are as small as pebbles.
                Most asteroids are made of different kinds of rocks, but some have clays or metals, such as nickel and iron.</p>
            <p>The three broad composition classes of asteroids are C-, S-, and M-types:-<br>
                *  The C-type (chondrite) asteroids are most common. They probably consist of clay and silicate rocks, and are dark in appearance. They are among the most ancient objects in the solar system.<br>
                *  The S-types ("stony") are made up of silicate materials and nickel-iron.<br>
                *  The M-types are metallic (nickel-iron). The asteroids' compositional differences are related to how far from the Sun they formed. Some experienced high temperatures after they formed and partly   melted, with iron sinking to the center and forcing basaltic (volcanic) lava to the surface.</p>
            <p>NASA has launched several space missions to study asteroids, including the NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft, which landed on Eros, an asteroid near Earth, in 2001, and the Dawn spacecraft, which orbited and studied the giant asteroid Vesta and the dwarf planet Ceres.
                Asteroids are not a threat to Earth, but tiny meteors burn up in Earth's atmosphere all the time.
                However, scientists monitor asteroids for potential impact threats to ensure the safety of our planet.Overall, asteroids are fascinating objects that provide valuable insights into the history and evolution of our solar system.

            <h2>Introduction to Satellite</h2>
            <p>A <strong>satellite</strong> is an object that orbits around a larger object, such as a planet, star, or moon, in a regular and repeating path.Earth is a satellite that orbits the Sun, while the Moon is a satellite that orbits Earth.
                The word "satellite" can also refer to a machine that is launched into space and moves around Earth or another body in space.</p>
            <p>Satellites can be used for various purposes, such as collecting scientific information, taking pictures of planets, the Sun, black holes, dark matter, or faraway galaxies.
                They can also be used for communications, such as TV signals and phone calls around the world, and for GPS, which helps figure out exact locations.</p>

            <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Navigation satellites, such as those part of the Global Positioning System (GPS), provide precise location and timing information to users worldwide.</li>
                <li>Satellites orbit at different altitudes depending on their intended purpose.</li>
                <li>Many satellites are the result of international collaboration between governments, space agencies, and private companies.</li>

            <h2>Satellites</h2>
            <p>There are two main types of satellites: natural and artificial. Natural satellites are objects like the Moon that form or are captured by the gravitational pull of a planet or star.
                Artificial satellites are man-made objects that are launched into space and orbit a planet or moon to collect information or be part of a communications system.</p>
            <p>Satellites can be used for various purposes, such as collecting scientific information, taking pictures of planets, the Sun, black holes, dark matter, or faraway galaxies.
                They can also be used for communications, such as TV signals and phone calls around the world, and for GPS, which helps figure out exact locations.</p>
            <p>Satellites have at least two parts in common: an antenna and a power source.
                The antenna sends and receives information, usually to and from Earth, while the power source, such as solar panels or batteries, powers the satellite.<br>
                Satellites orbit Earth at different heights, speeds, and along different paths.
                The two most common types of orbit are geostationary and polar.
                A geostationary satellite travels from west to east over the equator, moving in the same direction and at the same rate as Earth, making it appear stationary from Earth.
                Polar-orbiting satellites travel in a north-south direction from pole to pole, scanning the entire globe one strip at a time as Earth spins underneath.</p>
            <p>Satellites are important for collecting data over large areas quickly and for seeing into space better than telescopes at Earth's surface.
                They help meteorologists predict weather and track hurricanes, and they provide valuable information about the solar system and universe.</p>
